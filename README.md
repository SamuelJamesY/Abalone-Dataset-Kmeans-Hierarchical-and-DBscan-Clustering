# Abalone-Dataset-Kmeans-Hierarchical-and-DBscan-Clustering

Kmeans, Hierarchical and DBscan clustering algorithms were applied to a Abalone Dataset with the intention
of observing and key patterns/grouping in the predictor variables.
Inertia and Silhouette scores were calculated for the Kmeans clustering with different cluster amounts. 
An elbow plot revealed the optimal number of clusters to be 2. 
For the Hierarchical Clustering algorithm only the silhouette score was calculated. The score revealed that the 
optimal number of clusters was 2. 
For the DBScan clustering algorithm, different epsilon sizes were experimented with. The DBScan revealed 
that an epsilon of 0.14 was most effective in separating the predictor variables into clusters with the highest silhouette score.
